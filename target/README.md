High Quality Cut-n-Paste Guide for Testing your AngularJS [Controllers](patterns/controller.md), [Services](patterns/service.md), [Constants](patterns/constant.md), [Directives](patterns/directive.md) and [Filters](patterns/filter.md). As well as ideas on how to use [Mocks](patterns/mock.md), [End-to-End](patterns/e2e.md) tests, [Performance Testing](patterns/performance.md), [A/B Testing](patterns/ab.md) and [More](patterns/perceptualdiff.md)!

## What's an AngularJS Test Pattern?
A test pattern is a proven way to ~~properly~~ test a given feature of your AngularJS application. It's a design pattern for testing.

## Why?
This started as a place for me to jot down the patterns I've been using while building several AngularJS projects.

## Contributing Test Patterns
**Pull Requests Welcome!** I would love see these patterns evolve over time from community input as
more refined approches are discovered. So *please share what's working well for you!*

### Prepare your environment
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (NPM will come bundled).
* [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking) the [main repository](https://github.com/daniellmb/angular-test-patterns).
* Clone your Github repository: `git clone git@github.com:<github username>/angular-test-patterns.git`
* Go to the test patterns directory: `cd angular-test-patterns`
* Add the [main repository](https://github.com/daniellmb/angular-test-patterns) as an upstream remote to your repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/daniellmb/angular-test-patterns.git`
* Run `bash init-repo.sh` to initialize your local repository.

### To add a new test pattern* Edit or create a markdown file to hold your new test pattern.
* Add a [test pattern section](spec/lib/parse.util.coffee.md#anatomy-of-a-test-pattern-section) for your pattern
   * In your new section add [code blocks](spec/lib/parse.util.coffee.md#anatomy-of-a-test-pattern-code-block) for each of the [supported languages](spec/config.json#L2).
   * Edit the [example applications](/example) to satisfy your new pattern.
* Run `npm test` to ensure the pattern is valid. This does the following:
   * Unit tests the [test pattern rules](#unit-testing-the-patterns).
   * Unit tests that each pattern follows those rules.
   * Unit tests the [example applications](/example) against the patterns.

### Unit Testing the Patterns
To ensure a clear and consistent style of test patterns, every block of code must pass the following [rules](spec/rules) via `npm test` The rules are written in literate CoffeeScript so they are nicely self-documenting.

* [Test Pattern Language is Supported](spec/rules/code-lang.spec.coffee.md)
* [Test Pattern Language is Commented](spec/rules/code-comment.spec.coffee.md)
* [Test Pattern Code is Valid](spec/rules/valid-code.spec.coffee.md)
* [Test Pattern is Lint-Free](spec/rules/lint-free.spec.coffee.md)

### To add a new pattern rule* Create a new `<my-rule-name>.spec.coffee.md` literate CoffeeScript file in the `spec/rules` folder.
* Create a new `<my-rule-name>` folder in the `spec/fixtures` folder.
   * Add a text file for each of the supported languages, [see examples](spec/fixtures).
   * Make your fixture as specific as possible. For example, if you are testing that the pattern is [lint-free](spec/fixtures/lint-free/coffeescript.txt) you don't need to include a [code comment](spec/fixtures/code-comment/coffeescript.txt) as there is a separate test for that.
* Define your test pattern rule, [see examples](spec/rules).
* Run `npm run testRules` to ensure the rule passes using the fixtures.

### Submitting Your Changes
* Create and checkout a new branch off the master branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-fix-branch master`
* Create your patch, make sure that all tests pass.
* Commit your changes and create a descriptive commit message (the commit message is used to generate release notes, please check out the [commit message conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y) and the commit message presubmit hook [validate-commit-msg.js](hooks/validate-commit-msg.js)): `git commit -a`
* Push your branch to Github: `git push origin my-fix-branch`
* In Github, send a pull request to `daniellmb:master`
* When the patch is reviewed and merged, delete your branch and pull yours — and other — changes from the main (upstream) repository:
   * Delete your branch in Github, run: `git push origin :my-fix-branch`
   * Check out the master branch, run: `git checkout master`
   * Delete your local branch, run: `git branch -D my-fix-branch`
   * Update your master with the latest upstream version, run: `git pull --ff upstream master`
* If you need to make changes to your pull request, you can update the commit with `git commit --amend`. Then, update the pull request with `git push -f`.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

## The Future
Once we have a solid set of robust testing patterns, I'd like to get them integrated into a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) AngularJS [generator](http://yeoman.io/generators.html).
